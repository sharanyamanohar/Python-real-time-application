      "Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.\n",
      "After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.\n",
      "This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.\n",
      "Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.\n",

      "The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.\n",
      "Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.\n",
      "Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.\n",
      "The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be eighteen mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.\n",

      "Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.\n",
      "Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.\n",

      "Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.\n",
      "Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.\n",
      "Based on this, a lateral release was performed.\n",
      "The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.\n",
      "The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.\n",
      "Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.\n",
      "Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.\n",
      "The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.\n",

      "The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of ninety-nine minutes at two hundred and fifty mmHg.\n",
      "The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.\n",
      "The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.\n",

      "After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; ten cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.\n",
      "Routine prep and drape was employed.\n",
      "Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to two hundred and fifty mmHg pressure.\n",
      "Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.\n",
      "A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.\n",
      "Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.\n",
      "Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.\n",
      "Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of two-three cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.\n",

      "Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.\n",
      "Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.\n",
      "Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.\n",
      "Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.\n",
      "When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted five-zero nylon horizontal mattress sutures.\n",
      "A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a twenty-five gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.\n",
      "Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.\n",
      "Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.\n",
      "Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.\n"

      "Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.\n",
      "The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.\n",
      "At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.\n",
      "On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.\n",
      "It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.\n",
      "On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.\n",

      "Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.\n",
      "Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.\n",
      "Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.\n",

      "Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.\n",
      "A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.\n",
      "Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.\n",
      "Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.\n",
      "On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.\n",
      "Once this was done, all screws were tightened.\n",
      "Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.\n",

      "Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.\n",
      "A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.\n",
      "Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.\n",
      "Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.\n",
